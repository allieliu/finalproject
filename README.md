Let's try this again! 

During project two, I struggled with authentication and getting data from a third party. This time, I want to take another stab at it!

For [Redacted!], a user logs in with Twitter and the apps counts how many times they've used swear words in their tweets. The sample data is only recent tweets, with a maximum of around 180 tweets that is being tested on. 

Technologies used:
-Node.js
-Express
-JSON
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-JQuery
-AJAX
-Bootstrap
-HTML
-GitHub
-Heroku
-MongoDB
-MLab Database
-Twitter API

API Used
I used Twitter's API. A request is sent to Twitter, and Twitter returns a token. With the token, the user is authenticated without the app storing the user's password.

Major Hurdles
The documentation available while was useful, ended up providing the same error across the board. Getting authenticated on both Heroku and locally was the biggest challenge. Writing simple, concise code for counting a user's swears in tweets was also another hurdle.
